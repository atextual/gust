## Anticipated Questions

### Why make it?
If you give a man enough time to despise the tools he has, he will invent new ones. I'm not that man though, and this is just some code. Don't be weird about it.

### Isn't there already an app?
Yep! But no desktop, and it doesn't change colour so dramatically. Want something that doesn't change colours with flair? Not me.

### Do I have to spend thousands to even SEE it?!
Nope. Just load the app and enjoy your demo version. Buttons and buttons! Beep boop.

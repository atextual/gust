Gust integrates with your MyAir climate system, putting unmatched power and simplicity into your hands. It's where functionality meets aesthetics to redefine your interaction with home climate control, or something that a marketing team might write.

In reality it's just a cool application that does what you need.

## Anticipated Questions

### Why make it?
If you give a man enough time to despise the tools he has, he will invent new ones. I'm not that man though, and this is just some code. Don't be weird about it.

### Isn't there already an app?
Yep! But no desktop, and it doesn't change colour so dramatically. Want something that doesn't change colours with flair? Not me.

### Do I have to spend thousands to even SEE it?!
Nope. Just load the app and enjoy your demo version. Buttons and buttons! Beep boop.
